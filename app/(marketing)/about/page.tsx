They went over and above what I expected during our project, even taking on an additional project and doing our Family Rooms flooring project and installing LVP flooring. This was all done still within our time frame and we kept everything on schedule. Valjon and Cristain along with their connections with industry partners were able to streamline many of the projects timeframe and help keep them on budget. Plus all their resources were very knowledgeable and excellent in their area of expertise. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone for their next project and I am sure that soon it is going to be very difficult to get them without a long wait!!",

              <p className="text-gray-600 text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
                Welcome to Stone Works Remodeling! I’m Valjon Qejvani, and my journey into construction began as a teenager working with my father and with a strong foundation in engineering. After earning my degree from Western Michigan University and honing my skills working alongside my dad, I realized my true passion lay in building and remodeling spaces. Inspired by my father’s footsteps, I left the engineering field to start my own business, focusing on transforming homes and bringing clients’ visions to life.
